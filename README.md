## üë®‚Äçüíª Logistic Regression Result:
### ‚ñ∂ Summary of Logistic Regression:
![LR - 1](https://github.com/caesarmario/loan-prediction-SAS-studio/blob/main/Screenshot/Logistic%20Regression%20Output%20-%201.png)<br>
    üëâ The dataset on which the model was built has been correctly cleaned. <br>
    üëâ There are no more missing values (the number of observations reads and used is the same enabling the model to use every observation in the dataset). <br>
    üëâ The response profile reveals a highly unbalanced percentage between the two classes within the dependent variable, loan approval status, with a ratio of about 1:2 between N and Y. <br>
![LR - 2](https://github.com/caesarmario/loan-prediction-SAS-studio/blob/main/Screenshot/Logistic%20Regression%20Output%20-%202.png)<br>
    üëâ The Convergence Status of the Model is ‚ÄúSatisfied,‚Äù and the AIC value is smaller than SC. <br>
    üëâ These two examples demonstrate that the Logistic Regression Model is an effective predictor. <br>
![LR - 3](https://github.com/caesarmario/loan-prediction-SAS-studio/blob/main/Screenshot/Logistic%20Regression%20Output%20-%203.png)<br>
    üëâ It can be seen that marital status, loan history, and loan location has a significant correlation to loan approval status since the p-value is less than 0.05. <br>
![LR - 4](https://github.com/caesarmario/loan-prediction-SAS-studio/blob/main/Screenshot/Logistic%20Regression%20Output%20-%204.png)<br>
    üëâ The p-value column ‚ÄúPr > ChiSq‚Äù indicates that not all variables in the model are significant. <br>
    üëâ A p-value of less than 0.05 indicates that the variable significantly affects loan approval status variation. <br>
    üëâ Loan location and marital status impact loan approval choices. <br>
    üëâ It can be observed that work status and gender have little impact on loan approval results. <br>

### ‚ñ∂ Logistic Regression Model Output:
![LR Model Output](https://github.com/caesarmario/loan-prediction-SAS-studio/blob/main/Screenshot/Logistic%20Regression%20Model%20Output.png)<br>
    üëâ There are extra columns at the end of the dataset and the standard variables. <br>
    üëâ Each column contains an estimated result from the model together with the estimated probability. <br>
    
### ‚ö† Prediction Output:
![Prediction Output](https://github.com/caesarmario/loan-prediction-SAS-studio/blob/main/Screenshot/Prediction%20Output.png)<br>
    üëâ There is 1 new column showing the results of the status prediction output from the loan approval. <br>
    üëâ In addition, in addition to the new column that has been created, there is a probability of the loan application being rejected (N) and a probability of the loan application being accepted (Y).
